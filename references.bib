    abstract = "Air traffic control (ATC) is based on voice communication between pilots and controllers and uses a highly task and domain specific language. Due to this very reason, spoken language technologies for ATC require domain-specific corpora, of which only few exist to this day. The ATCOSIM Air Traffic Control Simulation Speech corpus is a speech database of non-prompted and clean ATC operator speech. It consists of ten hours of speech data, which were recorded in typical ATC control room conditions during ATC real-time simulations. The database includes orthographic transcriptions and additional information on speakers and recording sessions. The ATCOSIM corpus is publicly available and provided online free of charge. In this paper, we first give an overview of ATC related corpora and their shortcomings. We then show the difficulties in obtaining operational ATC speech recordings and propose the use of existing ATC real-time simulations. We describe the recording, transcription, production and validation process of the ATCOSIM corpus, and outline an application example for automatic speech recognition in the ATC domain."

    abstract = { Advancements in natural language processing (NLP) technologies offer a unique opportunity to furnish aircraft crews, primarily pilots, with digital instructions for taxiing operations. Digital taxi instructions, delivered either as text or graphics, can streamline taxiing procedures, thereby reducing radio congestion, minimizing communication errors, and enhancing aircraft monitoring. Techniques used for natural language understanding (NLU), a subset of NLP focused on machine comprehension of natural language, can extract taxi instructions directly from verbal radio communications. This capability paves the way for implementing a digital taxi communication framework with minimal adjustments to the existing air traffic controller operations. This paper delves into a novel application of NLU: the automated generation of digital taxi instructions from air traffic controller speech. We detail the development of an annotation scheme to represent aircraft ground traffic communications within the US National Airspace System (NAS), employing intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) to extract taxi instructions using NLU models. Several neural network models were trained on a dataset annotated with our scheme, achieving notable accuracy and F1 scores. Our research demonstrates the feasibility of using NLU to automatically generate digital taxi instructions, showcasing its potential to streamline the implementation of digital taxi communications. }
